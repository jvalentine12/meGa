# h1 What this project does? <br>
    This project takes what features a person wants in their car: the price range, type and style of it, where it will be delivered, how its size affects storage space, and its attributes.<br>
#How we built it?<br>
    We used javascript to have the information determine what the car looks like, jquery to create forms, css to style to form to fill out, and html to include the text boxes and determine the format of it. The project will look like a form for how the car will be customized and where it will be delivered.<br>
#Challenges we ran into?<br>
    Some challenges were finding images for the cars where the sizes varied. Another challenge was to put dropdowns for the buttons and have them print information to the next page. It was difficult to setup the results page objects and positioning them.<br>
#What we learned?<br>
    We learned about communicating better with one another so we know what we are doing. We learned more code like dropdowns and CSS elemtns to style to buttons.<br>
